# BMR Calculator and Diet Suggestion Program

## Project Description
This C program calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) based on user input of weight, height, age, and gender using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. It provides a rating of the BMR, recommends daily calorie and protein intake, and suggests dietary tips to optimize metabolism. This helps users understand their metabolic rate and make informed nutritional choices.
